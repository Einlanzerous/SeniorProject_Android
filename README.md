This is an application utilizing Riot's API to collect statistics and generate "scores" for players. In the current proof of concept stage, it pulls from a singular database when you request summoner names. NOT ALL RANKED DATA FOR REGION IS ON THIS SERVER. Meaning only some summoners are on here. Use the print server script (to be uploaded soon) to see what is on the server. 

Currently the app is totally functional as a standalone app. You do not need any backend scripts running. The backend scripts populate the database, but I've already done that. The database is hosted through mLab, so they should be available for the near future at minimum.
